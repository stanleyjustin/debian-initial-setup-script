##Set-up Scripts ##
As time has gone on and I have played around with different installs and broke them I ended up using this script quite a bit.
I soon realized that I would sometimes only need a certain component and that often times the script would fail due to a package name changing, a third-party repo changing, etc. 

This latest version has separated the scripts into a git/jasmine config, Ubuntu repo install, and then third-party repo install.
