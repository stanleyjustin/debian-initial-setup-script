## Debian Initial Setup Shell Script ##

This script sets up programs and packages that I want on every Debian workstation, installs jasmine for code testing, and sets up Git. At the end of the script the SSH key for Git generates and opens in VSCodium. 

### How to Use ###

1. open terminal
2. cd into folder
3. important: edit the username and email address to make it your own
4. chmod +x initial-setup.sh
5. ./initial-setup.sh

At the end of the script the SSH key for Git generates and opens in VSCodium.
