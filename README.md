## BASH Shell Scripts ##

This repository is a collection of shell scripts that I have created to make some of the initial setup tasks for Debian easier. They have been written for the BASH shell. 

Currently there are three scripts that are in current working order for Debian 10 Buster. 
1. init-setup.sh
2. jasmine-install.sh
3. git-setup.sh

There is a readme with the descriptions of what each command withing the folder containing the script. 


### How to Use ###

1. open terminal
2. cd into the folder of the script that you want to run
3. chmod +x foo.sh
4. ./foo.sh
5. any additional steps that the readme details
